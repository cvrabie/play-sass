play-sass
=========

[Sass][sass] asset handling plugin for [Play 2.1][play]. Implemented as [sbt][sbt]
plugin.

Prerequisites
-------------

[Sass][sass] compiler needs to be installed for plugin to work. This means that `sass` executable
needs to be found in path. Sass can be installed by by installing `sass` gem.

    gem install sass

You can verify that `sass` has been installed by following command:

    % sass -v
    Sass 3.1.16 (Brainy Betty)


Installation
------------

Add following to your projects `project/plugins.sbt`

    resolvers += "Patience Releases" at "http://repo.patience.io/"

	addSbtPlugin("net.litola" % "play-sass" % "0.2.0")

This adds Sass asset compiler to Play project. `*.sass` and `*.scss` files in `app/assets` 
directories will then be automatically compiled to `*.css` files. Files starting with 
`_`-character will be left out from compilation as per Play convention.

In addition you'll need to add settings to your project.

	import net.litola.SassPlugin

	val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, appDependencies, mainLang = SCALA).settings( SassPlugin.sassSettings:_* )

Versions
--------

The newest versions only support Play 2.1. If you need support for Play 2.0, please use
version from 0.1.x series.

* **0.2.0** [2013-03-01] Supports Play 2.1
* **0.1.3** [2013-02-04] Sass command line options can be overridden. Do not
